- 👋 Hi, I’m @jenjen0219
- 👀 I love being able to bring my ideas to life and build projects that challenge me in new ways.
- 🗣️ My goal as of now is to make an impact towards preserving the planet through my advocacy for all things sustainable. I also want to make things easier for folks when it comes to either the mundane or arduous tasks that perhaps a novice of sorts would struggle with. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with equally excited and motivated coders!
- 📫 How to reach me: jennifer.gutierrez@wsu.edu
